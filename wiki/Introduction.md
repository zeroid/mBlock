# Introduction
This is a fork of the [mBlock](https://github.com/Makeblock-official/mBlock) source.

mBlock is a graphical programming language. I want to teach my daughter robotics and programming so we brought an mBot. Unfortunately she has a Chromebook and I run a Linux computer so the current implementation of mBlock is not useful to us.

The goal of this repo is to port mBlock from Adobe Air to Javascript with the intent to run it as a HTML5 web site (for the Chromebook) and as an [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) application (for Linux, MacOS and Windows).
